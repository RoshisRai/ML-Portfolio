## Comparison with Other Clustering Methods
| Method | Pros | Cons | Best Use Case |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| **Hierarchical** | Visual dendrograms, no need to specify k | Computationally expensive O(n³) | Small to medium datasets, exploratory analysis |
| **K-Means** | Fast, scalable | Requires pre-defined k, assumes spherical clusters | Large datasets, known cluster count |
| **DBSCAN** | Finds arbitrary shapes, handles noise | Sensitive to parameters | Noisy data, irregular cluster shapes |
