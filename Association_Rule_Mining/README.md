## Algorithm Comparison
| Method | Pros | Cons | Best Use Case |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| **Apriori** | Easy to understand, finds all frequent patterns | Can be slow with large datasets | Small to medium retail datasets |
| **FP-Growth** | Faster than Apriori, more memory efficient | More complex implementation | Large transactional databases |
| **Eclat** | Efficient for sparse datasets | Limited to frequent itemsets only | High-dimensional sparse data |

## Business Impact Metrics
- **Cross-Selling Opportunities**: Rules with lift > 1.5 indicate strong bundling potential
- **Inventory Optimization**: Frequent itemsets guide product placement strategies
- **Marketing ROI**: High-confidence rules (>60%) suitable for targeted campaigns
- **Customer Experience**: Product recommendations based on purchase patterns

## Data Requirements
- **Transactional Format**: Invoice-based transaction records
- **Minimum Transactions**: 1000+ transactions for meaningful patterns
- **Product Diversity**: 20+ unique products for effective analysis
- **Data Quality**: Clean product descriptions and valid transaction identifiers
